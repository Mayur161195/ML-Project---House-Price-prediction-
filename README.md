# ML-Project---House-Price-prediction-
This is my first ML project on House Price prediction on a Bengaluru Real estate Data 

The task is to predict the price of a house given certain features of real estate in Bangalore 
Since the data has been provided with a target column as price,the problem /task falls under supervised Machine learning 
The target feature is continuous data and involves prediction hence a Regression Algorithm is to be developed
